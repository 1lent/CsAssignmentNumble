    Added Gambling system i asked carl to playtest my game he said it was alright bit boring so added this
    What it does is you start with 1000 and when this is called you input the money u want to bet and it takes it from your bal
    if you guess the number your money will get doubled but thats in another function

    i used recursion again here to recall the function if the user enters -1 money as that was a bug if they bet negative number
    if they lost they would get the money

    if the money is <0 they would lose and go bankrupt ending the game.
    I made it < instead of <= so if they didnt want to bet anything.
